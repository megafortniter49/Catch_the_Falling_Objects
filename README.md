# Catch the Falling Objects Game

## Description
This is a simple Python game made using Pygame where the player controls a basket to catch falling objects like fruits or coins. The game starts easy with slower falling objects and less frequent appearances, and gradually increases in difficulty by increasing the speed of falling objects and their spawn rate. The player has 5 lives and loses a life for every object missed. The game tracks the duration of play and displays the player's survival time at the end.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python (3.6 or newer)
- Pygame

First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website. Then, install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Game
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code. Navigate to the directory containing the game files in your terminal or command prompt. Run the game with:

```bash
python catch_falling_objects.py
```


Make sure to replace `catch_falling_objects.py` with the actual name of the Python script if it's different.

## How to Play
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the basket and catch the falling objects.
- Avoid missing any objects. You have 5 lives, and you lose one each time an object falls off the screen.
- The game becomes progressively harder as the speed of falling objects increases and they spawn more frequently.
- Try to survive as long as possible to increase your score!

## Controls
- **Left Arrow Key**: Move the basket left.
- **Right Arrow Key**: Move the basket right.
